# PsNixOs
A basic PowerShell module for verifying, testing, and applying your NixOS configuration file.

Do you use PowerShell as your primary shell on NixOs? Does it feel wrong to type Linux commands into your PowerShell command-line?
These functions are for you. Is this important? Nope! But it feels better to me, so it exists.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/griffeth-barker/PSNixOS.git
```

### Option 1: Importing the Module
You can import the module as follows:
```PowerShell
Import-Module -Path ./PSNixOS.psd1
```

### Option 2: Dot-sourcing
Alternatvely, you may dot-source each of the functions manually:
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem | ForEach-Item {
  . $_
}
```

This module may potentially be more richly featured with an actual release and publishing to PSGallery, but we'll see.
