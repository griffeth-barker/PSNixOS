# PSNixOS  
![](images\psnixos-icon-128x128.png)  
PSNixOS is a basic and unofficial PowerShell module for verifying, testing, and applying your NixOS configuration file.  
  
Do you use PowerShell as your primary shell on NixOS? Does it feel wrong to type Linux commands into your PowerShell command-line?  
These functions are for you. Is this important? Nope! But it feels better to me, so it exists.  
  
## Getting Started  
### Get the Module
[![PSGallery Version](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/v/PSNixOS.png?style=for-the-badge&label=PowerShell%20Gallery)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSNixOS/) [![PSGallery Downloads](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/dt/PSNixOS.png?style=for-the-badge&label=Downloads)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSNixOS/)  
  
You can install the module from the PowerShell Gallery.
  
```PowerShell
# Install using Microsoft.PowerShell.PSResourceGet module, which is PowerShellGet's successor.
Install-PSResource -Name PSNixOS -Repository PSGallery

# Install using PowerShellGet module, which is no longer in active development.
# Install-Module -Name PSNixOS -Repository PSGallery
```
